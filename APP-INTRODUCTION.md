# How to Use MAAS Practice

This is practice for real consultations. Type what you would say to the patient. Take your time — the slower pace of writing helps you think before you speak.

Don't worry about being perfect. Real consultations aren't perfect either. What matters is that you're practicing the skill of finding the right words.

## Commands you can use

- **"pause"** — when you need time to think. The patient will wait.
- **"feedback"** — when you want to know how you're doing so far.
- **"advice"** — when you're stuck and want a hint.
- **"summary"** — at the end, to see what you've learned.
- **"again"** — when you want to try that last part differently.

## One important thing

We take your diagnosis and treatment seriously. If you tell Mr. Lee he has angina and start him on aspirin, that's what happened. When you see him next time, he'll have been living with that. What you do in one consultation carries forward to the next.

Pay attention to your words. The way you phrase a question changes what the patient tells you. Writing it down helps you see that.
